# CS Explorations
by Moo Joon Park

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
This unit will explore fundamental concepts of programming utilizing LEGO EV3 Robotics.
Students will investigate vehicle autonomous systems using various sensors to understand
how these systems work in real life. This unit fits into the CS curriculum for freshman and
sophomore high school students who may never have been exposed to CS in middle school. This
will serve as an introduction to a Python Fundamental Course in their junior or senior year.

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
I decided to make this unit because it would be a very engaging method for students to learn
CS for the very first time. They not only see their programs on the screen but will see their
programs come to life through the robots.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

9-12CT.1 Use computing tools and techniques to create artifacts. [P2]	Challenge activities result in the creation of a (simple) algorithmic solution and an accompanying program that implements it.
9-12CT.10 Collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts. [P6]	Students work in teams to accomplish tasks.
9-12CT.2 Analyze computational artifacts. [P4]	Students perform debugging on their own code, as well as analyze and evaluate others’ code and suggested code in Reflection Questions.
9-12CT.1 Use programming as a creative tool. [P2]	Students use programming to solve model challenges based on challenges real robots face.
9-12CT.2 Develop an abstraction. [P2]	Robots gather information about the world through sensors, which turn physical qualities of the world into digital abstractions. Students must understand and work with this data to develop then implement their solution algorithms.
9-12CT.1 Use models and simulations to raise and answer questions. [P3]	Students construct and use a “program flow” model of programming itself to understand how the robot uses data to make decisions and control the flow of its own commands.
9-12CT.6 Develop an algorithm designed to be implemented to run on a computer. [P2]	Students develop solution algorithms to each challenge and mini-challenge problem before implementing them as code. Reflection Questions also ask students to evaluate algorithms expressed as pseudocode.
9-12CT.8 Express an algorithm in a language. [P5]	Students develop code to robotics challenges in the EV3 Programming Language.
9-12CT.5 Explain how programs implement algorithms. [P3]	Students must communicate solution ideas within groups and as part of class discussion, as well as in Reflection Questions.
9-12CT.9 Evaluate a program for correctness. [P4]	Students test and debug their own code, and evaluate others’ in the Reflection Questions.
9-12CT.5 evelop a correct program. [P2]	Programmed solutions to challenges must work.
9-12CT.10 Collaborate to solve a problem using programming. [P6]	Students develop solutions in teams.
9-12CT.5 Employ appropriate mathematical and logical concepts in programming. [P1]	Relationships such as “distance per wheel rotation” are important to making solutions work.
9-12CT.8  Connect computing within economic, social, and cultural contexts. [P1]	Reflection Questions ask students to make evaluative recommendations based on the impacts of robotic solutions in context.
