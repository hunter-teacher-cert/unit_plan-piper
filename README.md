# CS Explorations - Autonomous Vehicles
by Moo Joon Park

-----

### General Overview

This unit will explore fundamental concepts of programming utilizing LEGO EV3 Robotics.
Students will investigate vehicle autonomous systems using various sensors to understand
how these systems work in real life. Students will investigate systems that simulate how autonomous vehicles self-park, then how they avoid obstacles using senors and motors, then how they navigate on the road using color sensors. This unit fits into the CS curriculum for freshman and sophomore high school students who may never have been exposed to CS in middle school. This will serve as an introduction to a Python Fundamental Course in their junior or senior year.

### Motivation for Unit

I decided to make this unit because it would be a very engaging method for students to learn
CS for the very first time. They not only see their programs on the screen but will see their
programs come to life through the robots.

### Standards Referenced

List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)
9-12CT.1 Use computing tools and techniques to create artifacts. [P2]	Challenge activities result in the creation of a (simple) algorithmic solution and an accompanying program that implements it.
9-12CT.10 Collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts. [P6]	Students work in teams to accomplish tasks.
9-12CT.2 Analyze computational artifacts. [P4]	Students perform debugging on their own code, as well as analyze and evaluate others’ code and suggested code in Reflection Questions.
9-12CT.1 Use programming as a creative tool. [P2]	Students use programming to solve model challenges based on challenges real robots face.
9-12CT.2 Develop an abstraction. [P2]	Robots gather information about the world through sensors, which turn physical qualities of the world into digital abstractions. Students must understand and work with this data to develop then implement their solution algorithms.
9-12CT.1 Use models and simulations to raise and answer questions. [P3]	Students construct and use a “program flow” model of programming itself to understand how the robot uses data to make decisions and control the flow of its own commands.
9-12CT.6 Develop an algorithm designed to be implemented to run on a computer. [P2]	Students develop solution algorithms to each challenge and mini-challenge problem before implementing them as code. Reflection Questions also ask students to evaluate algorithms expressed as pseudocode.
9-12CT.8 Express an algorithm in a language. [P5]	Students develop code to robotics challenges in the EV3 Programming Language.
9-12CT.5 Explain how programs implement algorithms. [P3]	Students must communicate solution ideas within groups and as part of class discussion, as well as in Reflection Questions.
9-12CT.9 Evaluate a program for correctness. [P4]	Students test and debug their own code, and evaluate others’ in the Reflection Questions.
9-12CT.5 evelop a correct program. [P2]	Programmed solutions to challenges must work.
9-12CT.10 Collaborate to solve a problem using programming. [P6]	Students develop solutions in teams.
9-12CT.5 Employ appropriate mathematical and logical concepts in programming. [P1]	Relationships such as “distance per wheel rotation” are important to making solutions work.
9-12CT.8  Connect computing within economic, social, and cultural contexts. [P1]	Reflection Questions ask students to make evaluative recommendations based on the impacts of robotic solutions in context.

### Tools Used

The programming language used is Javascript programming for EV3 robots which is available on makecode.mindstorms.com. A base model EV3 is necessary along with a serial cable to copy the programs to the base unit.

### Resources

(include any links/books/readings to be used during this unit)
https://makecode.mindstorms.com/
This is the main programming platform which will be used by the students

https://makecode.com/blog/lego/05-15-2018
This is a good introduction to the makecode environment, especially for those who have never done EV3 programming or those who used the older lego.mindstorms software.

### Assesments

Summative assessments can be made during the testing and improvement phases of each lesson. Observing how students overcome obstacles and challenges as they arrive at their final programs.
A formative assessments can be done at the end of the unit. What types of sensors were used, what device settings should be used for a given maneuver, what are the similarities and differences  between the autonomous vehicles in the real world vs. the robots in the classroom, etc.

Final Project: Program a robot to successfully all three phases of self-driving cars will be part of the formative assessment.

Here is the rubric for the final project:
